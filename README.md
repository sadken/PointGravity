# PointGravity
Simple gravity simulation in FreeBasic

Written in Freebasic (Available here: https://www.freebasic.net/ ) the code simulates basic gravity between upto 100000 particles and a central object. 

UP/DOWN Arrows adjust the speed of the simulation. 
LEFT/RIGHT Adjust the initial speed of the particle (direction angle is random)
+/- Adjust the particles mass
B Resets particles with a burst (all 100000 particles released at once)
M Enables/disables mouse mode.  Allows you to move the central mass around with the mouse. 
D Toggles particles drawn as points or circles. 
E Toggles particle recycle. 
R Resets simulation
ESC exits the simulation.
